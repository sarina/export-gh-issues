https://api.github.com/repos/openedx/.github/issues/2,2,Switch repos over from edx org shared workflows to openedx shared workflows,"Based on a meeting of @nedbat , @feanil , and @carlosmuniz.

Context:
* This .github repo was copied from https://github.com/edx/.github
* We copied the repo instead of moving it because certain files *should* differ between the two orgs, such as the welcome page and security policy.
* Furthermore, we want a core set of `./workflow-templates` (e.g., ""upgrade requirements"") to be available in both organizations, which will require some amount of those templates to exist, duplicated, in each organization's .github repo.
* However, the _implementations_ of those shared workflows (in `./.github/workflows`) are currently duplicated between each organization, which isn't great.

AC:
* De-duplication:
  * If a shared workflow implementation is related to Open edX, then it should be defined in this repo only.
  * If a shared workflow implementation is edX-specific, then it should be defined in edX's .github repo only.
  * Before deleting the extraneous workflow implementations, all references to shared workflow implementations must be updated to point at the logical organization.
  * Fully completing this step will also require normalizing repos that currently use a _copy_ of the shared workflow instead of reference to the shared workflow.
  * Example: the definition of commitlint belongs solely in openedx's .github repo. We will need to go to every repo in the openedx organization and make sure its commitlint workflow is a pointer to the shared openedx commitlint workflow, **not** the edx commitlint workflow and **not** a copied implementation.
* Each organization's' .github repo should contain all the `./workflow-templates` it needs, duplicated between orgs if necessary.
